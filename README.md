# Advanced Computer Vision Tasks

This repository contains implementations of advanced computer vision tasks completed as part of the course materials from [@advanced_cv_1403](https://github.com/MhmudAlpurd/advanced_cv_1403).

## Overview

This repository focuses on implementing cutting-edge computer vision techniques that go beyond traditional image classification and object detection. The tasks demonstrate advanced approaches in machine learning and computer vision that handle scenarios with limited or no training data.

## Tasks Implemented

### 1. Few Shot Learning
Few-shot learning addresses the challenge of learning from a limited number of training examples. This implementation demonstrates:
- Model architecture for few-shot learning
- Training with limited data samples
- Evaluation on novel classes with few examples
- Techniques for feature extraction and metric learning

### 2. Zero Shot Learning
Zero-shot learning enables recognition of unseen classes without any training examples. Key aspects covered:
- Semantic embedding space creation
- Visual-semantic mapping
- Inference on unseen classes
- Implementation of ZSL architectures

### 3. Fine Grained Image Classification
Fine-grained image classification focuses on distinguishing between subtle variations within a category. Implementation includes:
- Detailed feature extraction techniques
- Attention mechanisms for focusing on discriminative parts
- Handling of subtle inter-class variations
- Performance optimization strategies
